# Big Data Specialization from University of California San Diego
Cousera online course, Big Data specilization, created by University of California, San Diego, taught by Ilkay Altintas(Chief Data Science Officer), Amarnath Gupta(Director, Advanced Query Processing Lab) and Mai Nguyen(Lead for Data Analytics), they all work in San Diego Supercomputer Center(SDSC) .

During this Specialization I was trying to understand big data and how it will impact business, try to gain an understanding of what insights big data can provide through hands-on experience with the tools and systems used by big data scientists and engineers.Try to be guided through the basics of using Hadoop with Map-reduce, Spark, Pig and Hive. By following along with provided code, try to get experience how one can perform predictive modeling and leverage graph analytics to model problems. This specialization will prepare me to ask the right questions about data, communicate effectively with data scientists, and do basic exploration of large, complex data-sets. In the final Capstone Project, developed in partnership with data software company Splunk, i'll apply the skills i learned to do basic analyses of big data.
