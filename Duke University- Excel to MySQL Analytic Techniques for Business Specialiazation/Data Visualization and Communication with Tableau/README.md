# [Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau – Week 1](https://jbsbraindumpdatabase.wordpress.com/2015/12/23/week-1-data-visualization-and-communication-with-tableau/)
## Ten Tips for Becoming a Data Analyst
1. Ask questions, nourish curiosity, and embrace the unknown
2. Start thinking about everything you see as a dependent variable or independent variable
“If I wanted to know more about this relationship, what would be the dependent variable, and what would be the independent variable?”
3. Start exploring the advantages of Continuous vs. Discrete Variables
4. Continuous variable – Can be any value in between a minimum and maximum value
Discrete variable – Can only be a specific set of values (democrat vs republican)
5. Listen AND Contribute – It is important to understand the business landscape so your recommendations are aligned with company values and intuitions
Train your skepticism muscles
6. SEEK details
7. Cherish precision
8. Best practices do not equal common practices
9. Expectations matter! – What you present needs to be somewhat aligned with expectations or it will not be well received.
10. Put yourself in other people’s shoes – Understand what your partners and stakeholders think when developing your solution.

## Asking the Right Questions
A study asked business leaders to select which qualities they most desired in a new business analyst. The top three choices are below:

1. Communication
2. SQL and query skills
3. Basic analysis skills

## SMART Objectives
Sample questions:
1. What problem is this business having that you hope to solve by developing this project?
2. Can you tell me more how this problem is affecting the business?
3. What is your ideal outcome for this project?

## Listening to Stakeholders during Elicitation
The process of elicitation, drawing out or bring forth information from people, is an important step throughout the project life cycle.
1. Identify your key stakeholders
2. Identify independent variables to test
3. Determine whether stakeholders agree about the problem to be solved

## Stakeholder Expectations Matter
1. Descriptive analytics – What happened?
2. Diagnostic analytics – Why things happened?
3. Predictive analytics – What is going to happen?
4. Prescriptive analytics – Recommendations of what should happen?

## Using SPAPs to Structure Your Thinking
At this point the business analyst should have already identified their dependent variable through SMART goals and their independent variables through elicitation sessions. However, before jumping into the data analysis it is important to set up an analysis plan. An analysis plan will help the analyst articulate what you are going to do, stay on track, get feedback along the way, and have a framework to understand the insights you find.

One of the skills that characterizes great business data analysts is the ability to communicate practical implications of quantitative analyses to any kind of audience member. Even the most sophisticated statistical analyses are not useful to a business if they do not lead to actionable advice, or if the answers to those business questions are not conveyed in a way that non-technical people can understand.
In this course you will learn how to become a master at communicating business-relevant implications of data analyses. By the end, you will know how to structure your data analysis projects to ensure the fruits of your hard labor yield results for your stakeholders. You will also know how to streamline your analyses and highlight their implications efficiently using visualizations in Tableau, the most popular visualization program in the business world. Using other Tableau features, you will be able to make effective visualizations that harness the human brain’s innate perceptual and cognitive tendencies to convey conclusions directly and clearly. Finally, you will be practiced in designing and persuasively presenting business “data stories” that use these visualizations, capitalizing on business-tested methods and design principles.
